# elementary-walkers
one or many walkers can interact and take various hyper-parameter values to explore a simple landscape  

## Intro 

This repository is designed to collect data on various ways of training simple neural networks. It can run SGD on multiple workers where they may interact (Ã  la EASGD or Robust Ensembles), it can run GD and SGD for a comparison, it can interpolate between all workers at each iteration, it can calculate the full spectrum of the Hessian and/or top/bottom few eigenvalues, it can interactively change hyperparameters after predetermined timesteps and it can do random walk on the loss surface. Training can be done on true labels or on soft labels. The dataset can be corrupted in several ways. 

## Dependencies  
Required packages: 
- [Torch7](http://torch.ch)
- [fb.python](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fblualib/blob/master/fblualib/python/README.md)
- pandas and numpy for python 2.7
  
*NOTE:* Beware that this code has tricky dependencies, I encountered some issues setting `fb.python` up on MacOs.
