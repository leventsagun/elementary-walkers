# elementary-walkers
one or many walkers can interact and take various hyper-parameter values to explore a simple landscape  

This repository is designed to collect data on various ways of training simple neural networks. Most of it have been written by me during the summer of 2016 when I was an intern at Facebook AI Research.

- [Torch7](http://torch.ch)
- [fb.python](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fblualib/blob/master/fblualib/python/README.md)
- pandas and numpy for python 2.7
